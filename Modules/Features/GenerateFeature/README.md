# GenerateFeature

This package contains the code that is responsible for generating the 
Swift Packages defined in the `PhoenixDocument` value that it receives.

It contains the Views that are added to the Editor toolbar, as well as the popover 
view that allows the user to give access to the proper folders and files before generating
the Swift Packages and syncing them with the Xcode Project.
